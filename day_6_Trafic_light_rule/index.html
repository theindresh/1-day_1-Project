                        The color 'RED' on the signal light indicates to stop well before
                        the stop line and not to crowd the intersection. Turn left in a red
                        signal only when there is a sign to do so. While turning, yield the
                        right of way to pedestrians and vehicles coming from other
                        directions.

                        YELLOWâ€”A yellow signal light warns you that the red signal is about to appear. When you see the
                        yellow light, you should stop, if you can do so safely. If you can't stop, look out for vehicles
                        that may enter the intersection when the light changes.

                        A Green signal at the intersection means to drive ahead. When a green traffic signal is
                        displayed, oncoming traffic has been stopped and it is safe to drive forward. Even so, maintain
                        caution while driving through a green signal as there may be pedestrians or cars jumping a red
                        light
